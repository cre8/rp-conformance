## Profile applicability

- Relying Party requests credentials in ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdoc format.

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Technology

- Presentation of a credential in ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdoc format.

## Preconditions

1. The Relying Party is set to `default_configuration_rp_1`.
2. The test environment publishes `default_trust_configuration_rp`, and the Relying Party has loaded it.
3. Test case `RP_WS_IA_MainInteraction_001b` passed in the same environment.

## Test Scenario

1. Perform a presentation for `default_query_pid` in which the Conformance Wallet presents, in an otherwise valid Authorization Response, a variant of `default_credential_pid` that differs from it only in that the `validFrom` value in the `validityInfo` of its MSO is set to the current time plus `T_skew` plus one hour.

## Expected results

1. The Relying Party rejects the presentation: its verification result reports a failure and releases no attribute value from the presentation, and the endpoint receiving the Authorization Response does not answer with HTTP status 5xx.

## Comments

Execute this test case once for each presentation flow the Relying Party supports (redirects, W3C Digital Credentials API).
